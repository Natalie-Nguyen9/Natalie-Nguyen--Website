        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">BiologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Natalie Nguyen, I am 19 years old, and I was born and raised in Lancaster, California. My parents immigrated from Vietnam and we travel to Vietnam frequently to give back to our family and community. My family and I are very humble and in touch with our roots. My parents and I work tirelessly to ensure that our friends and family in Vietnam are well taken care of. In my spare time I like to participate in community service. I was President of my Key Club Chapter in highschool and carried that over with me to University. I never stopped doing community service. It is more rewarding to me than any other activity I have ever participated in. It's something that means a lot to me and I will continue to do community service for as long as I can.<br><br>

        In my academic career I decided to enter University as a biology major and pre-med professional path. I decided in high school when I was part of the Kiaser Permanente Medical Explorers Program. Now I participate in Shadow MD and AMSA. In Shadow MD, I shadow doctors and learn how to diagnose and treat patients gaining hands on experience in the medical field. Not only do I shadow doctors at their private practice, but I also participate in other Shadow MD activities such as, making Christmas cards for children at the Children's Hospital and assembling hygiene kits for the local free clinic. I also participate in AMSA and volunteer in health fairs and other activities for the community that include providing service to the homeless population, like hot meals. As a member of AMSA I have access to guest speakers from medical schools and MCAT tuturs to further enrich our Pre-Med Journey.<br><br>

        Aside from volunteering and organizations, in my personal life, I work as a nail technician. My mom owns a nail salon, but she's the sole nail technician. I started doing nails when I was 15 to help my mom retain clients. Now I do nails on my own here at the University. It helps me get by while my parents work back home to sustain our family here in the states and Vietnam. I learned to do nails for survival, but now it is something I enjoy doing. I feel very fulfilled when I see clients satisfied with the work I have performed on them. It also helps me to express myself creativity. I have the opportunity to try new techniques on clients and strengthen my skills further.<br><br>
        
        From a very young age I have been humble and hardworking, just like my parents. I carried those traits with me over to University, where I work hard in my STEM classes to reach my goal. I have struggled, but I am relentless. I do not want to give up easily and learned from my parents, as I get to set the same example for my siblings. As the first in my family to attend University, I hope to achieve my goal and help others through community service along the way.
